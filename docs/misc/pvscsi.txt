PVSCSI

Overview

PVSCSI allows to assing a "physical" SCSI device from dom0 to a domU. The device
is not limited to be a native SCSI device. Everything visible as SCSI device in
dom0 can be used. Currently PVSCSI is only available in Linux dom0 and domU.


History

Support for PVSCSI was added to the classic xenlinux kernel and to xend in
xen-3.3 in 2008. Support for PVSCSI was added to the upstream pvops kernel 3.18
in 2014.


Config Format

The domU.cfg syntax is "vscsi=[ 'pdev,vdev[,option]' ]". pdev is the dom0 device
in either /dev/$device or pHOST:CHANNEL:TARGET:LUN notation.  vdev is the domU
device in vHOST:CHANNEL:TARGET:LUN notation. 'option' lists additional flags.
Currently only the value "feature-host" is recognized. SCSI command emulation on
backend driver is bypassed when "feature-host" is specified.


Xenstore Format

The backend driver uses a single_host:many_devices notation to manage domU
devices. Everything is stored in /local/domain/0/backend/vscsi/. The xenstore
layout looks like this:

    <domid>/<vhost>/feature-host = "0"
    <domid>/<vhost>/frontend = "/local/domain/<domid>/device/vscsi/0"
    <domid>/<vhost>/frontend-id = "<domid>"
    <domid>/<vhost>/online = "1"
    <domid>/<vhost>/state = "4"
    <domid>/<vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-0/p-dev = "8:0:2:1"
    <domid>/<vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-0/state = "4"
    <domid>/<vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-0/v-dev = "0:0:0:0"
    <domid>/<vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-1/p-dev = "8:0:2:2"
    <domid>/<vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-1/state = "4"
    <domid>/<vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-1/v-dev = "0:0:1:0"

The frontend driver maintains its state in /local/domain/<domid>/device/vscsi/.

    <vhost>/backend = "/local/domain/0/backend/vscsi/<domid>/<vhost>"
    <vhost>/backend-id = "0"
    <vhost>/event-channel = "20"
    <vhost>/ring-ref = "43"
    <vhost>/state = "4"
    <vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-0/state = "4"
    <vhost>/vscsi-devs/dev-1/state = "4"
