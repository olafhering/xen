PVSCSI

== Overview ==

PVSCSI allows to assing a "physical" SCSI device from dom0 to a domU. The device
is not limited to be a native SCSI device. Everything visible as SCSI device in
dom0 can be used. Currently PVSCSI is only available in Linux dom0 and domU.

== TODO ===

How to do live migration?
 - pdev will likely be evaluated again on the target host if it came from
   domU.cfg. But what about pdev from 'xl scsi-attach pdev vdev'? Its required
   to adjust h:c:t:l on the target host.

How to handle FIXME in libxl_retrieve_domain_configuration?
 - "MERGE(vscsi, vscsis, COMPARE_DEVID, {});", when does this code run?
 
Implement libvirt integration.
 - Is the API used by xl usable for libvirt?
 - How does libvirt assign a raw SCSI device?

    In libvirt-speak, this is SCSI host device assignment
    http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsHostDev
    Here's the SCSI example
      <devices>
       <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='scsi' sgio='filtered' rawio='yes'>
        <source>
         <adapter name='scsi_host0'/>
         <address type='scsi' bus='0' target='0' unit='0'/>
        </source>
        <readonly/>
        <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='0' target='0' unit='0'/>
       </hostdev>
      ...
      </devices>
    I suppose 'feature-host' maps to attributes such as 'sgio' and 'rawio'.
    The source element describes the SCSI device as seen from the host.


== History ==

Support for PVSCSI was added to the classic xenlinux kernel and to xend in
xen-3.3 in 2008. Support for PVSCSI was added to the upstream pvops kernel 3.18
in 2014. Backends exists just for Linux. A frontend exists for Linux, and maybe
for FreeBSD according to google.


== Config Format ==

The domU.cfg syntax is "vscsi=[ 'pdev,vdev[,option]', 'pdev,vdev[,option]' ]".
'pdev' describes the physical device, preferable in a persistant format.
'vdev' is the domU device in vHOST:CHANNEL:TARGET:LUN notation, all integers.
'option' lists additional flags which a backend may recognize.


== Configuring xenlinux backend ==

"pdev" is the dom0 device in either /dev/scsidev or pHOST:CHANNEL:TARGET:LUN
notation.  Currently only the option value "feature-host" is recognized. SCSI
command emulation in backend driver is bypassed when "feature-host" is
specified.

Its recommended to use persistant names "/dev/disk/by-*/*" to refer to a "pdev".
The toolstack will translate this internally to "h:c:t:l" notation, which is how
the backend driver will access the device. Using the "h:c:t:l" notation for
"pdev" in domU.cfg is discouraged because this value will change across reboots,
depending on the detection order in the OS.


== Configuring pvops backend ==

The backend driver in the pvops kernel is part of the Linux-IO Target framework
(LIO).  As such the SCSI devices have to be configured first with the tools
provided by this framework, such as targetcli. The "pdev" in domU.cfg has to
refer to a config item in that framework instead of the raw device.

The LIO uses a concept of backstore and frontend drivers. LIO backstore drivers
provide access to the actual storage, LIO frontend drivers provide an interface
which is accessed with SCSI commands. Within the LIO the frontend is connected
to a certain backstore.

For Xen its recommended to use the PSCSI backstore. Other backstores may work as
well, but they are not tested. The xen-scsiback module is the LIO frontend, and
at the same time the backend for the domU. In general the config flow is:
- the LIO backstore refers to physical storage in a persistant way
- the given storage gets a free, unique name within the LIO backstore
- the LIO frontend refers to that free, unique name in the LIO backstore
- the connection to the LIO backstore gets a naa.WWN:LUN in the LIO frontend
- the "pdev" in domU.cfg refers to that naa.WWN:LUN in the LIO frontend

Example for targetcli and a xen-scsiback aware python-rtslib:

 # modprobe -v xen-scsiback
 # DEV=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-TSSTcorp_DVD+_-RW_TS-H653G_R4576GFZ638411
 # NAME="my_dvd"
 # NAA=$(printf "naa.%s\n" `od -N 8 -t x8 -A n < /dev/urandom`)
 # targetcli "/backstores/pscsi create name=$NAME dev=${DEV}"
 # targetcli "/xen-pvscsi create wwn=$NAA"
 # targetcli "/xen-pvscsi/$NAA/tpg1/luns create /backstores/pscsi/$NAME"
 # echo "vscsi=[ '${NAA}:0,0:0:0:0' ]"

The last line is the domU.cfg snippet.


== Interface in xl ==

xl scsi-attach domid <PhysDevice> <VirtDevice>[,<option>]
xl scsi-detach domid <VirtDevice>
xl scsi-list domid [domid, ...]


== Interface in libxl ==

To be defined so that both xl and libvirt pass in the same data.


== Interface in libvirt ==

Has yet to be found.
